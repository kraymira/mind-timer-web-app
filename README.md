# Mind Timer Web App

A learning project where I'm figuring out how web development works. I'm a QA Automation Engineer exploring full-stack development by building a simple meditation timer app.

## What I've Built So Far

- Basic Express.js server that actually runs
- Home page with HTML and CSS styling  
- Timer page (just the HTML structure, no working timer yet)
- Basic routing between pages (`/` and `/timer`)
- Static file serving for CSS and images
- Clean project structure with separated files

## How to Run

```bash
npm install
node index.js
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## What I'm Learning

- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js basics
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and soon JavaScript
- **File organization**: Keeping HTML, CSS, and server code separate
- **Routing**: How URLs map to different pages
- **Debugging**: What breaks and why (lots of trial and error!)

## What's Next

Planning to add:
- Actually working timer functionality
- Saving meditation sessions 
- User login
- Session history
- Maybe a database (SQLite)

## Tech Stack

- Node.js + Express.js
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (learning as I go)
- SQLite (planned)

## Why This Project?

This lets me apply my testing mindset while learning how things actually work under the hood.

**Current status**: Very basic but functional! The server runs, pages load, and I understand what each piece does.
